# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

## Overview

This project aims to identify credit card fraud using machine learning models. The dataset consists of transaction features, and the objective is to categorize transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. Multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, will be utilized to detect fraudulent transactions and create visualizations.

## Machine Learning Models: 
- Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy
- XGBoost Classifier: A gradient boosting technique that builds models sequentially to correct errors made by previous models
- Logistic Regression: A statistical method used for binary classification problems

Cited from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, the three models were identified to produce the most accurate and precise predictions, compared to Support Vector and Neural Network classifications for a similar dataset.
